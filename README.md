# easyCaptcha
easycaptcha is a Nodejs library that helps people by using a captcha.

# how it works
So basically it uses Nodemailer and a random number generator to send a random 6 digit code to the user. **No, it does not send your passwords and account data to me!, *feel free to inspect the code!***

# Upcoming Updates
- Adding support to `alert` and `prompt`

- Adding support for custom verification codes, instead of a 6 digit code you will be able to customize it!

# Credits
- Me.
