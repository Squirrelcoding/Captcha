# Our Security Policy
So, you may have noticed that you may have to sign in with your **Google** account to sign in for nodemailer! Dont worry about that! ***But***, we recommend you do the following steps to secure your google account:
- Enable 2 factor Authorization
- Use an alternative account!
And thats it lol. You should only download `easyCaptcha` from this page! Do not download it from anywhere else, they are either people who are stealing this work, or just did some stuff to the code to steal your account info.
